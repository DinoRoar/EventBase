# What is all this about?

Well it turns out im a lazy fucker and this is an eventstore adapter for an eventstore i was writing.


Yeah, thats right. I was writing a proto eventstore and wrote an adapter for the eventstore I am trying to avoid thinking about because it might influence my idea.

But sometimes you just gotta get shit done.


This is all because I want to validate the idea that I can use the Event and Message class in here
